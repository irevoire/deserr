# FAQ

## But why?
At Meilisearch, we wanted to customize the error code we return when we fail
the deserialization of a specific field.
Some error messages were also not clear at all and impossible to edit.

## What about the maintenance?
At Meilisearch we're already using deserr in production; thus, it's well maintained.

## Where can I see more examples of usage of this crate?
Currently, you can read our examples in the `examples` directory of this repository.
You can also look at our integration test; each attribute has a simple-to-read test.

And obviously, you can read the code of Meilisearch where deserr is used on all our
routes.
